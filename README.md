# arrow-game
This is simple implementation of genetic algorithm which I made. There is arrow what need to get in blue blocks then it gets a score. If arrow collides with obstacles, it dies, but there is a bunch of other arrows and you will see the best of them.
It's not the best code, I'll remake it, but I save it here for some reasons. :)
Btw there is a screenshot:
